<meta name="description" content="Lahore (لاهور) is Pakistan&#039;s second largest city, and the capital of the north-eastern Punjab province. It is widely considered the country&#039;s cultural capital. The heart of Lahore is the Walled or Inner City, a very densely populated area of about one square kilometre. Founded in legendary times, and a cultural centre for over a thousand years, Lahore has many attractions to keep the tourist busy. The Mughal and Sikh legacy survives in the Lahore Fort, Badshahi Mosque and Gurdwara, the Mall is lined with colonial-gothic buildings from the British Raj, and the suburbs of Gulberg and Defence feature palatial mansions and trendy shopping districts."/>

<p>Lahore (لاهور) is <a href="/en/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>'s second largest city, and the capital of the north-eastern Punjab province. It is widely considered the country's cultural capital. The heart of Lahore is the Walled or Inner City, a very densely populated area of about one square kilometre. Founded in legendary times, and a cultural centre for over a thousand years, Lahore has many attractions to keep the tourist busy. The Mughal and Sikh legacy survives in the Lahore Fort, Badshahi Mosque and Gurdwara, the Mall is lined with colonial-gothic buildings from the British Raj, and the suburbs of Gulberg and Defence feature palatial mansions and trendy shopping districts.

<p>Lahore is the second largest city in Pakistan with a population of roughly 8.5 million. The traditional capital of Punjab for a thousand years, it had been the cultural center of Northern India extending from Peshawar to New Delhi.  The origins of Lahore are shrouded in the myths of antiquity but Lahore is undoubtedly ancient. 
</p><p>Today, Lahore is certainly worth a visit - but don't come expecting a tranquil city overflowing with history, art and culture - these qualities do exist but are hidden under the surface of a sprawling south Asian city. Forward planning is recommended if the tourist is going to get the most out of what Lahore has to offer - the time of year to visit, the choice of hotel, the restaurants to dine at, the art galleries and the shopping areas to frequent are all key to getting the most out of your stay.
</p><p>Lahore is a friendly and socially liberal city.  There is an old saying, that in every Lahori, there is a Mughal prince. The city has known ages of cultural, intellectual, musical, literary and humanistic evolution, which has consequently led to the fermentation and over fermentation of this rich brew we call Lahore.

<p>Legend has it that it was founded about 4,000 years ago by Loh, son of Rama, the hero of the Hindu epic, the <b>Ramayana</b>. Reminiscence of its hoary past are the remains of a subterranean temple attributed to Rama, in the northern part of the <b>Royal Fort</b>. Historically, it has been proved that Lahore is at least 2,000 years old. After Islam came to South Asia, it became a center of learning, and attracted some of the region's greatest mystics, writers and artists. The people of Lahore, when they want to emphasize the uniqueness of their town say <b>“Lahore, Lahore aye” (”Lahore is Lahore”)</b> and <b>“Jinnay Lahore nu nahi takkeya, o jammeya e nai” (”He who has not seen or visited Lahore, is nor born yet” means ”A person should visit Lahore to get himself registered in the list of people who has been born”)</b>. Lahore is the city of poets, artists and the center of film industry. It has the largest number of educational institutions in the country and some of the finest gardens in the continent.Apart from being the cultural and academic center of the country, Lahore is the showcase for <b>Mughal</b> architecture in Pakistan. For more than 200 years, beginning from about 1524 AD, Lahore was a thriving cultural center of the great <b>Mughal Empire</b>. Mughal Emperors beautified Lahore, with palaces, gardens and mosques.
</p><p><b>Hieun-tasng</b>, the famous Chinese pilgrim has given a vivid description of Lahore which he visited in the early parts of the 7th century AD. Lying on the main trade and invasion routes to South Asia, Lahore has been ruled and plundered by a number of dynasties and hordes. Muslim rule began here when <b>Qutub-ud-din Aibak</b> was crowned in Lahore in 1206 and thus became the first Muslim Sultan of the subcontinent. It waxed and waned in importance during the Sultanate.
</p><p>However, it touched the zenith of its glory during the <b>Mughal</b> rule from 1524 to 1752. The Mughals, who were famous as builders, gave Lahore some of its finest architectural monuments, many of which are extinct today. 
</p><p>It was Akbar’s capital for 14 years from 1584 to 1598. He built the massive Lahore Fort on the foundations of a previous fort and enclosed the city within a red brick wall boasting 12 gates. Jahangir and Shah Jahan (who was born in Lahore) extended the fort, built palaces and tombs, and laid out gardens.
</p><p>Jahangir loved the city and he and his wife Noor Jahan are buried at Shahdara. Aurangzeb (1658-1707), gave Lahore its most famous monument, the <b>Badshahi Masjid</b> (Royal Mosque) and the <b>Alamgiri</b> gateway to the fort.
</p><p>During the eighteenth century, as Mughal power dwindled, there were constant invasions. Lahore was a suba, a province of the Empire, governed by provincial rulers with their own court. These governors managed as best they could though for much of the time it must have been a rather thankless task to even attempt. The 1740s were years of chaos and between 1745 and 1756 there were nine changes of governors. Invasions and chaos in local government allowed bands of warring Sikhs to gain control in some areas.
</p><p>Lahore ended up being ruled by a triumvirate of Sikhs of dubious character and the population of the city invited <b>Ranjit Singh</b> to invade. He took the city in 1799. Holding the capital gave him enough legitimacy to proclaim himself the Emperor. Descriptions of Lahore during the early 19th century refer to it as a “melancholy picture of fallen splendor.”
</p><p>The British, following their invasion of Lahore in 1849, added a great many buildings in <b>“Mughal-Gothic”</b> style as well as bungalows and gardens. Early on, the British tended to build workaday structures in sites like the Fort, though later they did start to make an effort to preserve some ancient buildings. The <b>Lahore Cantonment</b>, the British residential district of wide, tree-lined streets and white bungalows set in large, shaded gardens, is the prettiest cantonment in Pakistan. Since Independence in 1947, Lahore has expanded rapidly as the capital of Pakistani Punjab.
</p><p><i>All this makes Lahore a truly rewarding experience. The buildings, the roads, the trees and the gardens, in fact the very air of Lahore in enough to set the mind spinning in admiration.A poet has written about this phenomenon one experiences in the environs of Lahore. </i>When the wind whistles through the tall trees, when the twilight floods the beautiful face of the Fort, when the silent canal lights up to herald the end of another chapter in history, the Ravi is absorbed in harmony, mist fills the ancient streets, and the havelis come alive with strains of classical music, the spirit of Lahore pervades even the hardiest of souls.

<p>Lahore is a huge and sprawling city.  In the old town walking or a tuk-tuk are your only options. You get to see a lot more on foot, just remember to wear comfortable shoes if you are going to be walking a great distance. Outside of winter it will be too hot to walk long distances during the day. Sunday mornings are quiet and are a good time to explore.
</p><p>Beware about asking address from people in Lahore. You will often be misguided and will end-up going somewhere else. Ask two or three people to confirm the address. Using the GPS function on your phone can be helpful.

<p>The hop-on hop-off open-top double-decker bus is one of the best way to explore Lahore. The tour takes almost two hours, with traffic, and covers more than 30 landmarks; beginning at the Gaddafi Stadium (Liberty Chowk) in the south-east of the city and ending in the north-west, at the Minar-e-Pakistan. The Sightseeing Lahore bus currently runs twice a day. The fare is 200 rupees (£1.32), students 100 rupees (66p).

<p>The central Metro Bus line <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.pma.punjab.gov.pk">[31]</a> runs from the northern tip of the city (Shahdara) to the (currently) southern-most town (Gajju-Matta). The buses are frequent, air-conditioned, safe and very comfortable. Determine the station closest to your destination before you get on and make sure that you get off at the right station: Lahore is an unplanned city and it is relatively very easy to get lost. You may wander for hours in narrow streets mere minutes from your actual destination, particularly in downtown Lahore.  Fare is Rs. 20 per passenger per trip. <b>Speedo Bus</b> is a free bus-link service (feeder buses) transporting passengers from various stops to Metro Bus Stations.

<p>Due to the traffic, distances, extreme heat, and hordes of goggling locals, however, most tourists will prefer to use other means of transport.

<p>Tuk-tuks or 'Qingqi'(pronounced chingchi) are open rickshaws with (narrow) rear-facing seats, or with two seats facing forward and two backward. They are handy for moving around in the Inner City, since it's easier to see where you're going. Tourists used to average western road etiquette might be horrified by the chaos on the roads - but it almost seems to work. Qingqi drivers have an unbelievable sense of space, speed and angles and you may well learn to trust them (or not). Rickshaws are the cheapest and, for women, the safest individual forms of public transport. <a href="/en/Haggle" class="mw-redirect" title="Haggle">Haggle</a> thoroughly with the driver; if you do not speak Punjabi or Urdu or are clearly a foreigner, try to get a Lahori friend to ensure you don't get ripped off. Try to find a rickshaw with a well-padded seat, otherwise you will come out bruised and aching.

<p>Taxis are a rarity on the streets of Lahore - with auto-rickshaws having cornered the market - for a  taxi you need to book one by phone. Most taxi drivers and, indeed, rickshaw drivers, carry mobile phones; it may be useful to take a number down if you find someone especially reliable. Ride sharing services like Uber, Bykea or Careem are also available. Do not take taxis in the Inner City, as the streets are narrow and very crowded. Either walk or take a qingqi. If you are a single person Bykea's Bike taxy will best suite you in Lahore's traffic.
</p><p><b>From the airport</b> - When you arrive at the airport you will likely be besieged with touts offering you taxis and rooms. It's wise not to book anything through them and arrange a taxi yourself to the hotel of your choice. Some of the mid-range and most top-end hotels offer a courtesy shuttle from the airport. If you do use an airport taxi then be firm, agree a price (which includes the Rs50 to leave the airport carpark) and pay in advance. Should be around Rs600 to Gulberg, Rs1,000 to the old town.

<p>Minivans are probably the most dangerous form of public transport, with very rash drivers. Women will find these especially uncomfortable, as they are very crowded.

<p>Lahoris are famed for their love of food, and the city is known for its wide array of local dishes and street food. Punjabi-style dishes reign supreme on the street, but midrange and upper range restaurants offer an array of international and continental cuisines. A restaurant’s price doesn’t necessarily correlate to better taste, but higher end places offer better eating spaces, and generally higher quality dishes. Top end places are the most hygienic options, but tend to focus on non-local cuisines. Additionally, American fast food outlets and restaurant chains are widely available throughout the city’s middle class areas, except in the Walled City.

<p>The vast majority of offerings in Lahore are budget options by Western standards. As with all of South Asia, hygiene standards vary, and seating arrangements are basic. Insist on freshly-cooked food if buying from a street vendor. It might seem rude in the West to ask such a question, but is totally acceptable in Pakistan - especially for a foreigner.

<p>Almost all of Lahore's high end restaurants are located in the city’s posher areas. Options in the Walled City are more limited. All restaurants in this category are considered hygienic. All restaurants are officially alcohol-free, but don’t be surprised if fellow patrons are seen enjoying alcohol - higher end places and patrons in posh areas often turn a blind-eye to discreet diners who bring their own drinks for dinner, though some religiously-observant servers may politely request you to pour your own alcohol.

<p><b>Alcohol</b> is illegal for Muslim Pakistanis, but alcohol is easily obtained as the country’s non Muslim population is free to drink, creating s lucrative black market for alcohol. Some of city’s high end hotels have bars serving alcohol to foreign guests. Some higher end restaurants will turn a blind eye to Pakistani patrons who bring their own bottle of alcohol to discreetly enjoy with dinner. Club events with flowing alcohol are quite popular for the city’s wealthier residents, but are not easy to find for visitors as the majority of events are private and invite only. Larger raves, or “melas,” also take place in the countryside around Lahore, but are invite only and feature tight security.

<p>For the visitor there are three broad options of areas in which to stay
</p>
<ul><li><b>1) In or near the old town</b> - has the advantage of having all the historical sights on your doorstep - however you are then limited for evening entertainment unless you want a long tuktuk ride. However the two 'rooftop' restaurants overlooking the mosque are nearby.</li>
<li><b>2) Along Mall Road</b> probably in one of the big and expensive chain hotels - you will be equidistant from the old town and the nightlife</li>
<li><b>3) In Gulberg or Defense</b> - where you will having the nice restaurants and shopping on your doorstep, and are nearer the airport.</li></ul>
<p>These tradeoffs are important because of Lahore's awful traffic, and you want to minimise the amount of (daytime especially) travel in the city.  Sunday mornings are very quiet however and this is a good time to visit Mall Road / the old town. 
</p><p>Hotels and guesthouses are the two main options in the city. Hotels are a bit more expensive but usually have western-style toilets and are cleaner.
</p><p><br />

<p>There are scores of options for travelers. If you feel like staying on budget there are some fairly crowded and over-priced options near the train station, which is in an overwhelmingly busy and chaotic part of the city - not for the faint-hearted. Westerners will often need to bargain if they wish to receive a fair price.

<p>Street crimes in Lahore are not common but special precautions must be taken by visitors.
</p>
<ul><li> Demonstrations aren't uncommon and should be avoided at all cost. In early 2006, the Prophet Muhammad cartoon protests quickly got out of hand, and several businesses were torched along with scores of cars. If a large demonstration or protest is underway, foreigners should try to remain at their hotels until the dust settles.</li></ul>
<ul><li> In general, visitors will find the locals very curious, very eager to help. Being friendly and smiling at people goes a long way. If you're a woman, though, it's best to be sparing with smiles lest people get too friendly; though this is mostly in areas like bazaars, not the actual city.</li></ul>
<ul><li>If you enter a mosque, women should wear a dupatta, which is a scarf used by local females to cover their heads. Men &amp; women should also remove their shoes at the entrance to a mosque.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Avoid traveling to unlit areas at night, especially alone. Use common sense when hanging out with friends, and definitely avoid being intoxicated in public as it is an Islamic country.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Beware of <a href="/en/Pickpockets" title="Pickpockets">pickpockets</a> when you are in crowded areas like Liberty market, the airport, bus stands, the railway station, Anarkali, Ichra shopping centre, or Mall road.</li></ul>
<ul><li> Don't trust or believe anyone. Corruption is widespread in Lahore and behind that smiling face is more likely than not a scam artist who will try to con you out of your money. Also, the police are just as corrupt or more so than the townspeople. Be careful; they are most likely working with the scam artist.</li></ul>
<p>In an emergency you can call <b>police help line 15</b> or call Rescue Services at 1122.
</p>

<p>Lahore abounds with excellent street food, but unless you've been on the road for some time and developed an iron stomach, it's always wise to exercise some caution. Look for busier street stalls, especially those in Gowal Mandi (food street), and stick to food that's hot and has just been cooked. Salads can also cause problems - if you must, one of the fancier restaurants in Gulberg is probably a safer bet than eating a salad at a <i>dhaba</i> or street stall.
</p><p>Bottled water is highly recommended. Some budget places offer free filtered water, but even that is suspect in Lahore.
</p><p>Medical care is excellent for those who can afford it and, if you can, avoid public hospitals. The <b>Fatima Memorial Hospital</b> is usually a fair bet, with decent rates, good hygiene, and good care.
</p><p>Doctors hospital on Canal and National Hospital in Defence Housing Authority offers excellent services but at a higher cost.
